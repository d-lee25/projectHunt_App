# ProjectHunt

The goal of this project is to develop a website for outdoor enthusiasts to come together and share stories, recipes, and have 
access to basics tools to prepare for the next adventure. 

The current theme is to focus on developing a place for hunters and will eventually include fishing. 

During this course - the goal includes: 
    * Create a main website with basic authentication
    * Upload previous work done on bear hunting analysis for Colorado into it's own page. 
    * Create a SQL (PostGres) server for inventory application
    * determine how I will transition my current Java Application to be hosted on the site.
